# Accepting Monero as a Payment for Regular E-commerce and Services Providers

## Applicability

Relevant if your business is unlikely to be cut off by regulated payment processors. This covers goods and services that are not only legal but also mostly unregulated in all major jurisdictions. Think all the usual services and goods like electronics, clothing, tickets and travel, food and groceries, books, sports and beauty products, etc.

## Monero Payment Processors

The easiest way is to connect one of existing cryptocurrency payment processors supporting Monero.

Using external payment processor makes the whole process easy and conceptually similar to connecting PayPal.

Here are some pros:

* **Pricing goods in your currency** - nothing changes in your pricing, the amount of Monero due is dynamically calculated by payment processor based on your actual prices

* **No need to handle Monero** - some payment processors will offer auto-settlement in USD, EUR or other national currency (through partner services)

* **No Monero volatility risk** - some payment processors will offer immediate conversion of your Monero to preferred national currency (through partner services)

* **USD/EUR withdrawals** - some payment processors will offer a wire, SEPA or PayPal withdrawals of your balance (through partner services)

* **Plugins** for all major e-commerce platforms for easy integration (WooCommerce, OpenCart, Shopify, PrestaShop, Magento, ...)


### GloBee

Pros:

* Payment processor originally founded by a proliffic Monero core team member
* Supports all major cryptocurrencies:
    * Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin (BTC) over Lightning, Monero (XMR), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), ...
* Plugins for most e-commerce platforms
* First class Bitcoin and Monero support + no shitcoin distractions
* Instant registration w/o formal review process
* Clean and pleasant user interface

Cons:

* USD/EUR settlements and withdrawals are not directly supported. Instead there is an option to auto-forward bitcoins to Luno, Uphold or BitPay. The business must first register in one of these services and go through their KYC and acceptance process
* Only established in late 2017
* Unclear development pace

Informational:

* Undisclosed legal entity and jurisdiction. This is perfectly fine in principle but makes reasoning about compliance and accounting implications harder for the clients
* Run mostly out of Johannesburg / South Africa

Cons:

* Monero is just one of hundreds supported coins. The support could be potentially outdated or dropped in the future. The company does not seem to participate in Monero community
* The user interface and UX is somewhat messy and clunky
* Shitcoin junky. With over 1000 coins and tokens supported, the payment processing technology is very unlikely to be ultra reliable
