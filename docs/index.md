# Unofficial Monero Documentation (2% done)

Monerodocs attempts to organize basic technical knowledge on Monero in one place.

The goal is to educate and onboard power users faster.

While technical explanations are out there, the information is scattered through reddit posts, git comments, stack exchange answers, chat logs and the source code.

This makes it hard to find complete and up-to-date explanations on advanced topics.

If you spot errors or issues please kindly drop me an email at [qertoip@protonmail.com](mailto:qertoip@protonmail.com?subject=monerodocs) or submit a github pull request.
